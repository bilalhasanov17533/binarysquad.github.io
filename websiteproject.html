        <h1>How did it start?</h1>
        <p>When we were given a limited time to complete this assignment <br> and briefly learn 3 languages, we were slighltly worried. Knowing <br> that we had other classes and assignments, we immediately started <br> taking online courses from Codeacademy that was provided to us, <br> and most of us finished it within a week. We were suprised with <br> how quickly you can learn HTML and CSS, although not fully, but <br> know enough to be able to construct a simple website. Considering <br> the fact that Codeacademy is free and for everyone, we did not face <br> any difficulties learning their courses. Eitherway, as simple as it <br> sounds, we faced quite a number of challenges during the process of <br> building this website.</p>

    <div class="wrapper5">
        <h1>What challenges did we face?</h1>
        <p>First and foremost, Bilal had a lot of assignments due in a short time <br> period, as well as an upcoming physics exam shortly after the Homework <br> was due. So we decided to discuss things in advance. We started by <br> coming up with a team name, which would turn out to be BinarySquad. <br> We chose this name because it represents 4 members (hence the name, <br> "squad") and what we are passionate about (no, not binary numbers, but <br> computer science and/or IT). Since we all had different schedules, <br> gathering together was a major setback which would delay our work. We <br> eventually found time to gather together and work on the website a few <br> times, however, as time went by, it gradually became harder for all four <br> of us to get together in real life. Instead, we split up into pairs, and <br> worked on specific sections of the website, and then once we found time, <br> we met to further enhance those sections. Additionally, our github was a <br> mess. A lot of files were placed into the team folder with similar names <br>, which was confusing and frustrating to organize. We managed to <br> complete our website just before the deadline, which although risky, <br> felt rewarding.</p>

        <h1>What else?</h1>
        <p>In conclusion, we are happy with the result. We tried our best to keep <br> the design minimalistic and professional. Communicating with eachother <br> was a key element when it came to making things work. This website <br> was created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Codeacademy <br> came to great help, and we would encourage everybody to use it. You <br> can find our Codeacademy profiles here:
