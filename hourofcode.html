            <h1>How was it planned?</h1>     
                  <p>Our initial step was planning an appropriate meeting with students. Our team planned the
                  event through our WhatsApp group and met in person for discussions. Kanan printed the
                  certificates, and we were ready to go. We decided on Baku IB School Lyceum No.6 as the event
                  location and agreed to host it on November 2nd. The Hour of Code event was held with 20 6thgrade students at that school. For the sake of being close to their current curricular activity, we
                  hosted Hour of Code during their IT subject. To begin, we introduced students to our educational
                  institution, ADA university and its faculties. We talked about our multinational group which is
                  open to all nations all over the world.</p>

            <h1>What challenges have we faced?</h1>
                <p>There were a couple of students who constantly
                  asked questions, demonstrated good knowledge, and were eager to learn more. We got such
                  students to volunteer in taking part in the real process of writing code for a specific task by
                  combining the interactive blocks supported in our program. Initially, the website language was in
                  English, and Azerbaijani sector students had trouble understanding tasks, so Bilal considered
                  changing the language to make the tasks clear for students. An additional act in the process was
                  that Turgay made some fake and wrong situations to demonstrate that computers are very precise
                  about small mistakes, and they must understand problems and steps to solution and output down
                  to the minute detail. The point was that one wrong statement may crush the whole structure of
                  the code. Regarding this point, two actively participating students added comments and brought
                  up specific examples from Minecraft</p>

            <h1>Q&A with Students</h1>
                  <p>We had a Q&A time with students about
                  the usage of coding in diverse areas. We answered the questions, and summarized by saying that
                  coding stays behind the system they pay for their things, the games they play, the videos and
                  images they see on different social platforms, and their family records at their school. We told
                  the students that there are a tremendous number of resources in the online world when it comes
                  to coding, problem-solving, and computational skills in case they want to enhance their
                  knowledge, skills, and information in these fields.</p>

                  students who participated and actively showed interest. We wish the best of luck to future Hour
                  of Code event makers in their intriguing and insightful journey.</p>
